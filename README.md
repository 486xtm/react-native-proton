### expo package

#### Install the dependency

```sh
# For Expo apps
expo install expo-activity-feed expo-permissions expo-image-picker

```

## Usage & Activity Feed setup

### Setup StreamApp component

In order to use Stream React Components in your application, you first need to initialize the `StreamApp` component. `StreamApp` holds your application config and acts as a service/data provider.

```jsx
<StreamApp
  apiKey='{API_KEY}'
  appId='{APP_ID}'
  userId='{USER_ID}'
  token='{TOKEN}'
  analyticsToken='{ANALYTICS_TOKEN}'
>
  {/* everything from your application interacting with Stream should be nested here */}
</StreamApp>
```

1. **API_KEY** your Stream application API_KEY
2. **API_ID** your Stream application ID
3. **USER_ID** current user's ID
4. **TOKEN** the authentication token for current user
5. **ANALYTICS_TOKEN** [optional] the Analytics auth token

You can find your `API_KEY` and `APP_ID` on Stream's dashboard.

#### Generating user token

The authentication user token cannot be generated client-side (that would require sharing your API secret). You should provision a user token as part of the sign-up / login flow to your application from your backend.

```js
const client = stream.connect(API_KEY, API_SECRET);
const userToken = client.createUserToken(userId);
console.log(userToken);
```

#### Generating analytics token

React components have analytics instrumentation built-in, this simplifies the integration with Stream. In order to enable analytics tracking, you need to initialize `StreamApp` with a valid analytics token. You can generate this server-side as well.

```js
const client = stream.connect(API_KEY, API_SECRET);
const analyticsToken = client.getAnalyticsToken();
console.log(analyticsToken);
```
